### Car Classification and Verification using Deep Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning-based pipeline for **fine-grained car classification** and **verification** using **ResNet-50**, **Inception v3**, and **Siamese Networks**. The models are trained and evaluated on the **CompCars dataset**, leveraging **ensemble learning, transfer learning, and contrastive learning** to improve classification and verification accuracy. 

## Features

- **Car Make & Model Classification:** Predicts the manufacturer (make) and specific model of a car using **ResNet-50** and **Inception v3**.
- **Part-Based Ensemble Learning:** Uses an ensemble method where car parts (e.g., headlights, taillights, dashboard) are independently classified, and a **majority voting strategy** improves accuracy.
- **Car Verification (Siamese Network):** Determines if two images belong to the same car make/model using a **contrastive learning-based Siamese network**.
- **Optimized Preprocessing Pipeline:** Includes image resizing, augmentation, and normalization tailored for both **ResNet-50** and **Inception v3**.

##  Dataset

The project is trained and tested on the **CompCars dataset**, which includes **web-nature** (online images) and **surveillance-nature** (real-world camera) images.

- **Make & Model Classification:** Uses **full car images** for classification.
- **Part-Based Classification:** Uses cropped **car parts** (headlight, taillight, fog light, etc.) to refine predictions.
- **Verification Task:** Pairs of images are used for training the **Siamese Network**.

## Part-Based Classification Example
This image shows how different car parts contribute to the prediction of the final model classification decision.

## Siamese Network for Verification
This image illustrates how the Siamese Network verifies if two car images belong to the same model.
